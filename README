Generates Matlab ODE files, from a chemical-equation-style file.

USAGE WITH BINARIES: 
Using the command line, place yourself inside the folder ODEgen; to generate the Matlab code, the command is: “_build/main.native file_name.txt” 

e.g.: _build/main.native text/G.txt


USAGE:

"make clean" for cleanup

"make" to generate executable "ODEgen"

"./ODEgen filename.txt" to generate the code for the specified file; !FILE MUST HAVE EXTENSION .TXT

Matlab code generated in Matlab_code directory, executable in Matlab via the "main.m" file


FILE FORMAT:

The .txt file must contains three sections (in this order): EQN, PARAMS and INIT

EQN: contains declarations of the reactions, of one of the forms : 


(coeff_1 "*" )? react_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? react_2 +... -> (coeff_1 "*" )? prod_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? prod_2 +... ; rate ("=" expression | value)?

(coeff_1 "*" )? react_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? react_2 +... <-> (coeff_1 "*" )? prod_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? prod_2 +... ; rate1 ("=" expression | value)?; rate2 ("=" expression | value)?


(coeff_1 "*" )? react_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? react_2 +... => (coeff_1 "*" )? prod_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? prod_2 +... ; rate ("=" expression | value)?

(coeff_1 "*" )? react_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? react_2 +... <=> (coeff_1 "*" )? prod_1 + (coeff_2 "*" )? prod_2 +... ; rate1 ("=" expression | value)?; rate2 ("=" expression | value)?

Different types of arrows: 	"->" mass action, ireversible
				"<->" mass action, reversible
				"=>" rate law, the reaction velocity is specified by the user, ireversible
				"<=>" rate law, the reaction velocity is specified by the user, reversible


PARAMS: contains parameter declarations of the form "param = value | expression"


INIT: contains initial conditions of the form "species = concentration"

See example files in the "test" folder.
